**NOTE** Lightbend has announced they are discontinuing Activator. I will be moving this to a giter8 template soon.

# minimal-scalajs
Minimal Scala.js activator template

This is just a pretty basic template to use when starting a Scala.js project.

It includes libraries for working with the DOM and jQuery in Scala.js
